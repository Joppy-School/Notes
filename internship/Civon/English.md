# My internship at the innovationcenter Civon

# Introduction
During my internship at Civon I worked on a few different projects. While working on these projects I was thrown into the deep end and had to learn a lot of new things on my own. This was because I had to automate a machine on my own. Despite me being thrown into the deep end I learned a lot of new things and I want to learn more about these things in the future. I have also did some other things like coding a little robot called Misty, I have also tested a few VR headsets and games. These games are `First Steps`, `Richie's Plank Experience`, `Beat Saber` and `Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes`. These games i have played on multiple different VR headsets. While I was coding misty I found a few different ways of coding her. These options are `Blockly`, `Python web interface` and `Python API`, While coding different small pieces of Misty I added everything into one and now it is the main software that we use to move Misty around.

# Assignment 1: Laser welding machine
The laser welding machine is a machine that uses high energy laser beams to make a piece of metal so hot that it will weld to another piece of metal. This is a very precise task. This means that the operator of the machine needs to have some experience with the machine, on top of that `BeGeDo` has 2 different laser welding machines and only has 1 operator most of the time. This means that one of the 2 machine will be turned off most of the time. So they assigned me to automate one of the 2 machines so that they can use both machines at the same time.

Maybe it is a good begin to explain a little about the history
